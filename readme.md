### Bootstrap Laravel

This script is intended for version 5.
It's a simple script that can help bootstrap your Laravel project.

To use, simply run (inside your project root directory):
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defaye/bootstrap-laravel/master/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

This bootstrapper does not run `npm install` or the asset compiler e.g. `gulp --production`. 

***Do not be under any assumptions as to what commands have been run, it is a good idea to inspect the script first so you are fully informed as to what it does.***
